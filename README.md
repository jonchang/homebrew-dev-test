# Jonchang Dev-test

This repository is retired. It served as an experimental external command that eventually became [`brew pr-automerge`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7344) as part of an effort to [migrate Homebrew away from Jenkins](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/6255). Since that effort has finished, there is no longer any need for this repository.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install jonchang/dev-test/<formula>`
